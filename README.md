## Authentication
We use Laravel Sanctum for API token authentication. Response to login and register endpoint contains a Bearer token to be used in Authorization header
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

I have added a [postman v2.1 collection](job board api.postman_collection.json) to the root of the project that has example and endpoints documentation
